  ```sh
  cd spring-auth-jwt
  ```

3. Ensure you have `app.key` and `app.pub` files in the `resources` directory. To generate these files, use the following commands:

  ```sh
  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out app.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  openssl rsa -in app.key -pubout -out app.pub
